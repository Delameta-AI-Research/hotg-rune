# Rune as containers

Containers are sandboxes for operating systems, in the MCU universe that looks like a sandbox where developers could use any OS or base layer to develop and deploy it any place.
Runes are our attempt at containers where all operating systems would run in a sandbox on an engine that is specific to devices. This is very different from Docker as the docker 
engine really only runs on one target (linux). In a rune we have many base targets which is why we have been looking at using webassembly as base target. Right now for the first
version we are really building the tooling to help explore how people will use these concepts. Our first version is essentially just webassembly applications wrapped with tooling
that is similar to the Docker concepts. I expect a lot of this to change as we continue to develop the `rune engine`.


# The Status Today

As I mentioned `runes` are a webassembly application with container-like tooling. Our next steps would be to have a set of SDK that allows providers to leverage `rune-engine`. As we 
develop use cases we will want to start  targeting a class of devices such  as:

1. MCUs
2. AI Sensors
3. FPGAs

The `rune-engine` would provide concepts similar to Linux Containers but at the hardware level. This way mbedOS, rtos and other OSs can be deploy add developers will have direct 
access to the hardware with security priniciples applied as policies.
