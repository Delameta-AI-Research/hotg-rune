# Contributing to the Rune Project

## Getting Started

The `rune` project is just another Rust project and can be compiled using
`cargo`.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/hotg-ai/rune.git
$ cd rune
$ cargo build --workspace
$ cargo test --workspace
```

Note that we pull in several large dependencies, so the first build may take
a couple minutes.

The project is split up into several smaller crates using [Cargo
Workspaces][workspaces], with the main crates being:

- `syntax` - The "compiler frontend" that parses and analyses Runefiles
- `codegen` - A crate that generates a Rust project that gets compiled as
  WebAssembly to make up a Rune
- `runtime` - Common abstractions and types used by the various Rune runtimes
- `wasmer-runtime` - A runtime which uses `wasmer` to execute WebAssembly using
  a user-provided `Image`
- `rune` - The `rune` command-line program, used for compiling and running
  Runes
- `rune-core` - Types shared between Runes, Proc Blocks, Images, and Runtimes
- `proc-blocks/*` - The various Rust crates that can be used as Proc Blocks
- `images/*` The various Rust crates that can be used as base images for a
  Runefile
- `integration-tests` - Our end-to-end test suite
- `xtask` - A helper program for various internal tasks
- `ffi` - FFI bindings for using `wasmer-runtime` from non-Rust programs
- `python` - Python bindings to various proc blocks and Rune functionality

## Integration Tests

As well as the normal unit tests that you would run with `cargo test` we've
developed a test suite which runs the `rune` program against real Runes.

All integration tests live inside the `integration-tests` folder and are split
up based on the how they are meant to be run by `rune`.

- `compile-pass` - the Rune should build
- `compile-fail` - The Rune should fail to build (e.g. so you can test error
  messages)
- `run-pass` - the Rune should be able to run with the specified capabilities
- `run-fail` - running the Rune should fail (due to a missing capability,
  crash, etc.)

Let's go through the process of adding an integration test which evaluates
the `microspeech` Rune and makes sure it can detect the word, "up".

The first thing to do is create a folder for it:

```console
$ mkdir integration-tests/run-pass/microspeech-up
$ cd integration-tests/run-pass/microspeech-up
```

Next we need to add our Runefile. Normally you'd write it from scratch but
because we are already using it as an example, we'll just symlink it into the
`microspeech-up/` directory.

```console
$ ln -s ../../../examples/microspeech/Runefile.yml ./Runefile.yml
```

This Rune also requires a `model.tflite` so we'll symlink that too.

```console
$ ln -s ../../../examples/microspeech/model.tflite ./model.tflite
```

If this was just testing `rune build` (i.e. a `compile-pass` or `compile-fail`
test) we could stop here. However, because we want to actually run the Rune we
need to supply it with any capabilities it will need.

The way this works is pretty simple. Say you would normally run the Rune with
`rune run ./microspeech-up.rune --sound up.wav` then just add an `up.wav` file
to the test directory.

```console
$ ln -s ../../../examples/microspeech/data/up/84d1e469_nohash_0.wav ./up.wav
```

Capabilities are determined based on their extension, so a `*.png` will be
passed in using `--image`, `*.wav` files are `--audio`, and so on.

By default, the only things that get checked are the exit code from `rune`.

|             | **pass**            | **fail**           |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| **compile** | `rune build` passes | `rune build` fails |
| **rune**    | `rune run` passes   | `rune run` fails   |

However, you can add additional checks to make sure particular strings are
printed to the screen. This is really useful when trying to improve error
messages and the end-user's experience, but for now let's just make sure
the Rune correctly outputs "up".

The first thing to do is run the Rune manually.

```console
$ rune build ./Runefile.yml
$ rune run microspeech-up.rune --sound up.wav
[2021-05-27T15:36:17.117Z INFO  rune::run] Running rune: microspeech-up.rune
[2021-05-27T15:36:17.153Z DEBUG rune_wasmer_runtime] Loading image

[2021-05-27T15:36:17.163Z INFO  runicos_base::image] Serial: {"type_name":"&str","channel":2,"elements":["up"],"dimensions":[1]}
```

We just care about that last log message so let's copy it to a new file. The
file can be called whatever you want as long as it has the `stderr` extension.

```console
$ cat expected.stderr
Serial: {"type_name":"&str","channel":2,"elements":["up"],"dimensions":[1]}
```

The integration test suite will scan a directory for `*.stderr` files and assert
that the output from `rune run` contains exactly that text.

Now the integration test is set up and we can run the test suite.

```console
$ cargo integration-tests
[2021-05-27T15:38:43.027Z INFO  rune_integration_tests] Looking for tests

```

If you look carefully you'll see `run-pass/microspeech-up ... ‚úì` indicating that
our test passed.

As a sanity check, let's modify `expected.stderr` to make sure the test is actually
doing something.

```console
$ cargo integration-tests
...

```

## Common Tasks

We use [`cargo xtask`][xtask] and cargo aliases to help with various things
during development.

The `cargo rune` alias will run a command using the `rune` binary in release
mode. This will also compile the binary, so don't be surprised if the command
seems to hang for a couple seconds on the first run.

```console
$ cargo rune --version
```

The `cargo xtask install-pre-commit-hook` command installs a git pre-commit
hook that will automatically run `rustfmt` whenever you make a commit.

The `cargo xtask dist` command generates a release bundle with all the
resources most people will need when getting started. Some things it includes
are:

- The `rune` binary compiled in release mode
- A header file and pre-compiled libraries (both static and dynamic) to allow
  the Rune runtime to be linked into a non-Rust application
- For each of the examples:
  - The compiled Rune
  - The original Runefile and TensorFlow Lite models
  - Any other data needed to train the model
  - A copy of the Rust code that is generated as part of `rune build`
- Python bindings for the various non-trivial proc blocks (for use in training)
- Other documentation that may be needed when using the project (README,
  license, etc.)

## Continuous Deployment

We've [set up GitHub Actions][nightly-yml] to generate a "nightly" build
every 24 hours.

This will run `cargo xtask dist` on several architectures and upload new
release bundles to [*Nightly Release*][nightly-release] on GitHub Releases.

You can also trigger a nightly build manually by navigating to the
[*Nightly Workflow* page][nightly-workflow] and hitting the *"Run Workflow"*
button. See [*Manually running a workflow*][manual-workflow] for more.

## Benchmarks

The `runtime/` directory contains several benchmarks for comparing things like
how long it takes to build a rune, startup times for the `Runtime`, and
execution time.

Benchmarks are done using [`criterion`][criterion] and you will need to install
their command-line helper, `cargo criterion`.

```console
$ cargo install cargo-criterion
```

Once that is done you can `cd` to the `runtime/` directory and run the
benchmarks.

```console
$ cd runtime
$ cargo criterion
   Compiling rune-runtime v0.1.0 (/home/michael/Documents/hotg-ai/rune/runtime)
